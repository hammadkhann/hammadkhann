I am currently doing MSc in Data Science at Glasgow University. I have three years of experience in a Data Science related role, working within a Retail and Eâ€‘commerce environment at scale. I have solid theoretical knowledge of Machine Learning and statistical concepts, including Deep Learning, common neural network architectures, specifically for recommendation systems, ranking and query understanding. I have an applied research mindset and stay close to recent developments in deep learning, NLP and Recommendation systems with an experience of formulating solutionâ€‘oriented ideas and bringing them into production with an eagerness to get realâ€‘customer feedback as soon as possible. I can present and communicate my ideas and findings to both technical and nonâ€‘technical audiences.
